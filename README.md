# laravel5
This is my project to learn laravel 5.
I'm using here is Laravel 5.6.29. with the tutorial from khoapham.vn. You may look for the series in this address(https://youtu.be/XJwhQumKCxU).
In the tutorial, they used the version before 5.6. (They could use the version before 5.1, I guess).
I have a little problem with the organization of this framework so it can't be very fast to commit, cause I watch a series in the older version and practice in a newer version. So for each step, I may need a lot of time to figure it out how to make it work.
